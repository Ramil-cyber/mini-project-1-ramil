# Python GitHub Template

![Python CI](https://github.com/nogibjj/mini-project-1-ramil/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This repository serves as a Python project template with continuous integration (CI) setup using GitHub Actions. Additionally, it includes a **.devcontainer** configuration for streamlined development within a Docker container using Visual Studio Code.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Local Development with VS Code and .devcontainer

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Install Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. If not, you can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
2. **Install VS Code Extensions**: Install the **Remote - Containers** extension in Visual Studio Code.
3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nogibjj/mini-project-1-ramil.git
    ```
4. **Open in VS Code**: Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.
5. **Reopen in Container**: When prompted, click on "Reopen in Container". Alternatively, you can press **F1**, type "Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container", and press Enter.
6. **Docker Image Build**: The first time you open the project in the container, Docker will build the image as specified in the **Dockerfile**. This may take a few minutes.
7. **Ready-to-Use Environment**: After the setup is complete, you will have a fully configured Python development environment isolated from your local system.

### üß™ Running Tests

To run tests and ensure your code is working as expected:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal within VS Code (you should already be in the correct directory if you followed the previous steps).
2. **Run Tests**: Execute the following command to run all unit tests:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
3. **Review Results**: Check the test output to ensure no new issues were introduced by your changes.

### üì¶ Installation of Dependencies

If you need to install or update dependencies:

1. **Edit `requirements.txt`**: Add any new Python packages you need.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command inside the container:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è File Structure
